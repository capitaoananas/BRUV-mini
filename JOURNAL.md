# June 6th: Sketches and sketches!

I made a whole lot of sketches before even going to CAD also of course research of the type of tinywhoop that i want and the components and also the sizes of everything.

So first i immediately went to [Rotor riot](https://rotorriot.com/products/bubito-built-tuned)'s website because i had already seen that mini drone they have called bubito and i really liked how it looked and then looked more into other whoops and builds so i also found [this](https://www.tinywhoop.com/collections/75mm-frames/products/copy-of-fractal-65-lite-brushless-frame-kit) frame i liked so i started to draw some sketches on my notepad so here are just the first 2 sketches

sorry for terrible image quality this was taken with my webcam

but yeah then i moved to CAD and i made a simple motor mount with the mounting pattern of the 6.6mm that the motors have. And the motor mount design was inspired by the fractal 75 frame.
So yeah this is the motor mount i made

I know the sketch is really messy but my brother taught me a way to make it way neater so in the future im going to use that!

**Total time spent: 2h**

# June 7th: Making the real CAD model!

So i started by trying to make a rough sketch in CAD of the whole frame but it was too hard to start making it from almost 0 so i went over again to my sketch book and make these 2 drawings

the one on the right was my final design i really like how it looks

So after these two drawing i was able to make the CAD sketch way better so yeah this is how it turned out

I went more like the design of the bubito frame design but with my own stuff like touches and stuff yeah i really like it!

**Total time spent: 3h**
