# June 6th: Sketches and sketches!

I made a whole lot of sketches before even going to CAD also of course research of the type of tinywhoop that i want and the components and also the sizes of everything.

So first i immediately went to [Rotor riot](https://rotorriot.com/products/bubito-built-tuned)'s website because i had already seen that mini drone they have called bubito and i really liked how it looked and then looked more into other whoops and builds so i also found [this](https://www.tinywhoop.com/collections/75mm-frames/products/copy-of-fractal-65-lite-brushless-frame-kit) frame i liked so i started to draw some sketches on my notepad so here are just the first 2 sketches

sorry for terrible image quality this was taken with my webcam

but yeah then i moved to CAD and i made a simple motor mount with the mounting pattern of the 6.6mm that the motors have. And the motor mount design was inspired by the fractal 75 frame.
So yeah this is the motor mount i made

I know the sketch is really messy but my brother taught me a way to make it way neater so in the future im going to use that!
